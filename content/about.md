Hi, I'm Yuyang! I'm currently a Software Engineer working in New York City.

I grew up in Manila, Philippines and moved to Philly to attend undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania. I graduated in 2022 with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, watching sports, reading memoirs and non-fiction books, and hanging out with friends!

Always happy to meet new people â€“ feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:yuyangwang2000@gmail.com).
